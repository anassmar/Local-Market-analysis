### 🚨 Critical Alerts & Replenishment

The dashboard highlights immediate operational risks:

   * Urgency: 8 products have fallen below the reproduction threshold (safety stock) and require immediate attention.

### 💰 Inventory Valuation

The financial value of the inventory is unevenly distributed across categories:

    * Dominant Category: Desserts represent the largest share of inventory value (approximately $10K), followed by Dairy Products (~$5K).

    * Optimization Opportunity: The "Viandes" (Meats) and "Boissons" (Beverages) categories show significantly lower valuation, which correlates with the observed stockouts (e.g., Roast Chicken).

### 📉 Stock vs. Demand Dynamics

The scatter plot (Quantité commandée vs Niveau du stock) reveals supply-demand imbalances:

    * Risk Zone: Several products (points located below the red dotted line) show high order quantities but stock levels well below the safety threshold.

    * Potential Overstocking: Conversely, certain products (top-right of the chart) appear to have comfortable stock levels relative to their demand
